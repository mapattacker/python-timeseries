Python Timeseries Analyses
======================================================

Images, natural language and timeseries are unique data that cannot be analysed or modelled 
through traditional methods. For the latter, each *row* of data might be signals or waves within 
a window frame of time, and requires prior preprocessing or unique models to deal with this 
additional dimensionality.

This documentation collates various timeseries analyses techniques. 
Many resources and pictures are sourced from other parties as indicated, 
so do attribute them as necessary.
